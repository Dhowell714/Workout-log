For this assignment, I used /wol instead of /journal. /wol for Workout Log. In hindsight, this might not've been the best idea but it made more sense to me while writing this. I also used the port "3002" because I had 2 servers currently running. One used the port 3000, and the other used 3001.

The Endpoints/Routes look like this:

    http://localhost:3002/wol/about (GET)
    http://localhost:3002/wol/practice (GET)
    http://localhost:3002/wol/test (GET)
